Have you ever heard of Markdown? It's a text markup language that allows you to create documents with formatting and organization in a simple and easy way. And now, I've developed an SPA called "Markdown Previewer" so you can try it all out!

With my SPA, you can write your text in Markdown and see a preview of the final result in real-time. Moreover, you can make edits to the text and see the changes instantly. All of this in a simple and intuitive interface, without needing to install anything!
